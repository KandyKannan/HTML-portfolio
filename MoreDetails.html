    <h3>Obstacle Avoidance Car</h3>
    <p>
        Obstacle avoidance cars are one of the important aspects of
        mobile robotics. This robot is built to sense any obstacle in its path.
        To avoid and resume its running involving the Pre-computation of
        an obstacle free path. Ultrasonic sensors were adapted to
        implement a real time obstacle avoidance system for wheel robots.
        So that the robot can continually detect surroundings, avoid
        obstacles, and move toward the largest area.

    <h3>Renewable Energy Power Storage device</h3>
    <p>Small external batteries that can be charged with solar energy and
        allow you to recharge without having to connect them to an outlet .
        Note that you can charge them by plugging them into a power
        outlet as well as with solar energy. They are normal power banks
        with solar panels.</p>
